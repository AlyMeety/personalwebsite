                            time, our primary priority was to polish the core game mechanics. I had a great time working
                            on a project like this with my other game maker friends. "3... 2.. 1. Clean!", whilst not
                            being
                            one of my more sophisticated projects, it undoubtedly was a really effective way for me and
                            our team to expand upon stuff like time management, coordination and brainstorming. On top
                            of all that, being able to push out a finished product in such a limited time, and with such
                            limited resources is most definitely quite a relieving and satisfying feeling.</p>

                        <p class="subtitle">For this drifting game; we had to keep the feelings of the player while
                            drifting in climax and encourage the player to drift. In order to balance the tempo of the
                            game, we designed the maps in the game to support the tempo and added a mission system to
                            the game. Thanks to these missions, we gave the player the opportunity to create his own
                            entertainment. In addition, we have added special billboards for each level in the game,
                            thus increasing the variety of monetization and adding variety to the sections. The most
                            important thing for us in this game was the feelings of the player while drifting. Not only
                            does this play with all the components of the car to get a smoother gameplay. As in every
                            game we used the camera as one of our strongest weapons</p>

                        <p class="subtitle">For this game inspired by Fluffly Fall; we looked for ways to keep the
                            players engaged with a simple mechanic. We experimented with various camera tricks to
                            enhance the feeling of falling down in Astroon Fall. We focused on designing the tubes
                            through which the players pass, making them simple enough not to confuse, while also
                            ensuring they remained innovative enough to avoid monotony. Our entire art team collaborated
                            to create visuals that complemented the mechanics seamlessly. Additionally, we introduced a
                            1v1 encounter, providing players with an online versus experience and carefully balanced the
                            match results to ensure fair competition.</p>

                        <p class="subtitle">In this game inspired by Vampire Survivors, we tried to keep the mechanics
                            as simple as possible and highlight the polishing phase in order to make the most of our
                            72-hour time. Adding a background story to the game was one of the best decisions we made.
                            We also discovered that the player can bond with the main character Symbinode much more,
                            thanks to the shapes that appear with the weapons that the player can attach to himself.
                            Weapon variety was the highlight of the game, so we saw how important it was to cut back on
                            other elements and focus on the right things.</p>

                            our first 3D game project on Unity, I took it upon myself to create all the 3D models and
                            animations. It was an exciting journey, and I thoroughly enjoyed every step of the process,
                            especially working alongside my friends. We faced challenges, learned new techniques, and
                            celebrated our accomplishments together, making the entire experience even more memorable.
                            This project not only enhanced my skills in 3D modeling and animation but also strengthened
                            our bond as a team.</p>

                            self-publishing. The process was filled with more fun and challenges than we could have
                            imagined. Despite encountering numerous errors, we persisted and listed the project on the
                            store successfully. This experience not only strengthened our bond but also ignited a sense
                            of pride and inspired us to pursue more ambitious projects together in the future.</p>

                        <p class="subtitle">In general, I am making games all the time, and when I am not making games,
                            I am designing and documenting the games that come to my mind. These games usually do not
                            see the light of day because they are above my height or because they are not suitable for
                            current trends. But it's not a big deal, I really like making these.
                            We can always talk about these games, you can mail me.</p>
